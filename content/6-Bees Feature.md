- Seneca's Letter 84 to Lucilius on Reading [[202302261340]]
     - Seneca tells Lucilius about note-taking using the bee metaphor.


Generations later, in ~430 CE, Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, repeated the same idea:

> "You should not count it a fault if I shall set out the borrowings from a miscellaneous reading in the authors' own words... sometimes set out plainly in my own words and sometimes faithfully recorded in the actual words of the old writers... We ought in some sort to imitate bees; and just as they, in their wandering to and fro, sip the flowers, then arrange their spoil and distribute it among the honeycombs, and transform the various juices to a single flavor by some mixing with them a property of their own being, so I too shall put into writing all that I have acquired in the varied course of my reading... For not only does arrangement help the memory, but the actual process of arrangement, accompanied by a kind of mental fermentation which serves to season the whole, blends the diverse extracts to make a single flavor; with the result that, even if the sources are evident, what we get in the end is still something clearly different from those known sources."

- Gathering Ideas And Combinatorial Creativity [[202306041721]]
     * Seneca proposed we gather ideas, sift them, and combine them into new creations—an early description of the ZKM.

- There is the added benefit of the bees helping pollinate the flowers, enhancing the ecosystem.
