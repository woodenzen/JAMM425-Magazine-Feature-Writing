MOSCOW, Idaho—Jill Kyong transforms chaos into connection. She finds meaning in the chaos of nature. She takes little cracks in the pavement, snippets of landscape, and burnt tree snags she stumbles upon and transforms them with a vision of calm, connection, and hope into colorful, vibrant, precise geometric artworks. 

In a time of political and cultural chaos, Jill Kyong, a wood sculptor and MFA candidate at the University of Idaho finds calm amid turmoil and explores feelings of separation and connection. Her work translates chaos into soothing geometric patterns overlapping into three-dimensional panels, bright with color. 

----------------------------------

Her journey really starts back in the 80s, in a rural farming community high school in Minnesota, back in the 80s. Funding was given for all things agricultural. "We had a huge welding shop, a large wood shop, but no art classes," said Kyong.

 She studied metal casting under nationally renowned foundry artist Wayne Potratz. Getting her undergraduate degree in art from the University of Minnesota. 

Marriage and family got in the way of Kyong's artistic journey for a bit. Then, she moved a couple blocks away from the Arkansas Arts Center and their woodshop in Little Rock, which sparked her passion and set her on the path to becoming a talented wood sculptor!

When her children were old enough to fend for themselves, Kyong decided to return to her passion for art. 

Kyong is getting her MFA in the spring of 2025 from the University of Idaho in Moscow. In addition to prepping for her MFA thesis show, she's teaching wood sculpture classes at the university.

----------------------------------

Kyong and her husband, Jeff McClain, love to hike, each with a different motive. McClain loves the exercise and the fresh air coming from being in nature, and Kyong draws inspiration from nature, making frequent stops to study and photograph small scenes. 

McClain describes her as a "slow hiker" because she's constantly stopping to observe and photograph the intricacies of nature. Her artistic eye finds beauty in unexpected places, like cracks in rocks, the way light filters through trees, or patterns in a landscape. 

While on a hike, "I might look back, and she's like looking down into some tree stump," said McClain.

She doesn't just take one or two pictures but studies a fragment of the scene, a moss-filled crack in a rock, and photographs it from multiple angles and distances. This turns any seemingly short hike into an all-day affair. 

McClain jokingly complains about her meticulous documentation, saying, "She needs about 30 pictures of that one thing."

This attention to detail and appreciation for the subtleties of nature contrast with McClain's desire for efficiency and forward momentum. This difference, while sometimes frustrating for McClain, is also a testament to Kyong's artistic vision.

----------------------------------

“I'm often taking moments based on chaos and stuff I find disturbing in society, trying to find the beauty in it, trying to find the calm that we can all agree on, and offering hope in that situation," said Kyong.

Her pieces often convey subtle messages inviting contemplation without being overtly explicit. For example, Growth, a 30-inch square wall sculpture, "originating from a photo taken of grass growing through a thin crack in the pavement along a road," said Kyong on her website. This inspired her to create a piece connecting this small natural scene with the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd's death. _Growth_ features a gray box with five smaller green boxes containing black and white stones. The central box holds both a black and white stone, symbolizing racial reconciliation. Kyong's art resonates with viewers on a personal level, even if they're unaware of the underlying message.

Between is a wall sculpture also 30 inches square, "about the spaces between mountains, the spaces between trees, and the space between humans." said Kyong on her website. She drew inspiration from the trailside burnt snags on a warm and sunny day in Glacier National Park. This piece is comprised of two pale white panels, one curved, and three black "trees" graphically spanning the panels and carved wooden stones nestled up against their base.

----------------------------------

Her art explores themes of nature, connection, and hope. She draws inspiration from the beauty of the natural world, seeking to bring a sense of calm and order to the chaos of modern life.

She strives to show a sense of calm in her work by trying different arrangements to see what moves her. It's done mathematically with geometric precision, so all the pieces have a relationship to each other. The elements are related in a way so there aren't areas of tension in the piece. 

"Many people tell me that they sense a feeling of calm and peace in the work," said Kyong.

On her slow hikes, Kyong pauses to capture details like cracks, light, and patterns, translating them into calming, vibrant, colorful geometric sculptures. It’s in these small, seemingly insignificant moments when she's staring into a crack in a sidewalk that Kyong discovers her journey toward connection, hope, and calmness.
