MOSCOW, Idaho—Jill never set out to be a wood artist—it wasn’t even on the radar. It wasn’t a dream or some inherited skill passed down from an artistic ancestor. Instead, it was more like a serendipitous accident. 

In high school, the artist worked in a busy welding program, pushing against gender boundaries. Then, in college, the focus fell on metal casting because there were world-renowned instructors available. Then, marriage and family attempted to interrupt Kyong's artistic trajectory. A move to Little Rock, Arkansas, proved to ignite her passion, and embarking on a journey to become an accomplished wood sculpturist.

#### The Twisted Path

Her path starts with high school, which featured a robust welding program in a rural farming town in northern Minnesota. The school didn't offer art classes until her junior year, when it hired an art teacher who also served as the cheerleading coach. 

For her undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, her artistic focus shifted to metal casting and glass construction. She studied under nationally renowned foundry artist Wayne Potras.

Life made a swerve. Married with two kids, the family moved to Little Rock, Arkansas. 

When her children went to college, Kyong-McClain **decided to return to her passion for art**. Having access to a wood shop near her home, she chose wood as her primary medium. She found wood to be a more unique medium than painting, which she felt was oversaturated in galleries.

Serendipitously, they landed a few blocks from the Arkansas Arts Center. They had a robust wood program with a fully equipped shop. After taking a couple of classes, Jill was asked to teach. Teaching became Jill's second passion.

Currently, Kyong-McClain is pursuing her MFA at the University of Idaho in Moscow. She is expected to graduate in the spring of 2025. She is also pursuing her passion for teaching sculpture classes at the university.

#### Slow Hiking for Inspiration

Jill and Jeff love to hike, each with a different motive. Jeff loves the exercise that comes from being in nature, and Jill draws inspiration from nature, making frequent stops to study small scenes. 

Her partner, Jeff, describes her as a "slow hiker" because she is constantly stopping to observe and photograph the intricacies of nature. Her artistic eye finds beauty in unexpected places, like cracks in the sidewalk, the way light filters through trees, or patterns in a landscape. 

While on a hike, "I might look back, and she's like looking down into some tree stump at something," said Jeff.

She doesn't just take one or two pictures but studies a fragment of the scene, a moss-filled crack in a rock, and photographs it from multiple angles and distances. This turns any hike into an all-day affair. 

Jeff jokingly complains about her meticulous documentation, saying, "she needs about 30 pictures of that one thing and different angles."

This attention to detail and appreciation for the subtleties of nature contrast with Jeff's desire for efficiency and forward momentum. This difference, while sometimes frustrating for Jeff, is also a testament to the artistic vision that drives Jill's work.

#### Her Art
Her pieces often convey subtle messages that invite contemplation without being overtly explicit. For example, a piece inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd's death features a gray box with smaller green boxes containing black and white stones. The central box holds both a black and white stone, symbolizing racial reconciliation. Kyong-McClain appreciates the idea that her art can resonate with viewers on a personal level, even if they are unaware of the underlying message.

Her art delves into the themes of nature, connection, and hope. She draws inspiration from the beauty of the natural world and seeks to bring a sense of calm and order to the chaos of modern life.

#### Jeff
Jeff describes being the designated driver on their trips to deliver and retrieve Jill’s artwork.
He's color blind, according to Jill. 

#### Ending

Kyong-McClain's educational journey reflects a lifelong interest in artmaking and resourcefulness in adapting to available opportunities. She is a testament to the fact that artistic paths are not always linear and that passion, combined with practicality, can lead to a fulfilling creative career.

Title " Sculpting Connection in a Divided World"
In a time of political and cultural chaos, Jill Kyong's story, a wood sculptor from rural Minnesota, is about finding calm amid turmoil and exploring feelings of separation and connection. Kyong fresh perspective broke the gender barriers in her education, leading to her discovery of wood as her inspiration and the rewards of creating art that represents human connection. Her work translates chaos in nature into soothing geometric patterns overlapping into three-dimensional panels that are bright with color. 

The story will explore her expressive use of materials and methods, focusing on how diversity, ecological themes, and cultural trends are represented in her work. She expresses her vision of nature with geometric patterns overlapping into three dimensions and uses natural and carved wooden "stones" to represent people in a scene. Now, pursuing an MFA at the University of Idaho, Kyong is preparing for her thesis exhibition, making a powerful connection between art and connection in an era when young people, especially, are feeling increasingly isolated. 

Her story will let readers get a tactile sense of her methods, why she chooses the materials she does, and the message flowing under the surface. Kyong's art speaks for itself. Calm and connection are needed now more than ever.
