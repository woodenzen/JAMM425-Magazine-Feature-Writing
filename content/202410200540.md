#### TIME

Interviewing tip
- Ask actors to imagine what will happen in the near future. This projects the story into the "realm of possibility."
- Ask the "in the trenches" actors what they think the future holds. 
- This can be used in a "looking ahead" ending.

#### VARIETY
- Provide different source types
- Repeat from a different angle.
- For reasons I don’t understand, the number three has a mystical, number.

#### MOVEMENT
- Describe physical movement by the actors in the story, bring interest. Have them do something, anything. 
  > In the clubhouse, metal cleats are clicking on the floor. On the bus, players are singing, plucking guitars, playing cards. Small things, yes. But they make a difference in a story without much action in the idea. I think, is that too many reporters don’t see themselves as storytellers but as something else
