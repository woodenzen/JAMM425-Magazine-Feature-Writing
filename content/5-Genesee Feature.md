        How One Officer Is Building Trust One High Five at a Time

MOSCOW, Idaho—When Latah County Sheriff Deputy Cody Brown walked into the classroom, he wasn’t there to break up a fight or investigate an incident. He was there to read “The Berenstain Bears Forget Their Manners” to a bunch of wide-eyed first graders, all hanging on his every word.
 
"It started a little intimidating just because there's a whole bunch of little kids looking at me, waiting for me to start their story," Brown laughs. "Once we got going, it was a lot of fun."
 
Brown has been on the job for two weeks. He’s the new full-time Student Resource Officer (SRO) assigned to the Genesee School District in Genesee, Idaho. As SRO, Brown combines law enforcement with mentorship in the schools. His position was created through the 2024 Millennial Fund, which added 27 SROs statewide as part of a tobacco class-action settlement.
 
Through daily interactions with students, he reshapes their views on police, builds trust, and enhances their school experience.
 
Brown, 32, grew up in Lewiston, Idaho, and is a former wrestler and father of a soon-to-be student. As a father and a sheriff's deputy, the chance to be the SRO for the Genesee schools was a no-brainer, personally and professionally. When on regular patrol, when he could, he loved stopping at schools to mingle with students.
 
Instead of his patrol car, his office will be on the Genesee school grounds, giving him a constant presence and making him available to both staff and students. Heather Kirk, the Genesee Elementary Principal, is excited about this change because they don’t have to share Brown with other schools or districts.
 
"He'll be able to really spend time in and become part of the school community," said Kirk. His time will be fully committed to their community, always at the school, available for activities, and able to respond immediately to any issues that arise.
 
Reading to the first-graders was only the start of the new Genesee SRO job description, "Some days, I'll go, and I'll lift weights with the students in the weightlifting class. Today, I made deviled eggs with the culinary arts class."
 
Picture it: The fit and well-built Officer Brown, clean-shaven with a classic close-cropped cop’s haircut, outfitted in his uniform, in a flowery print apron, making deviled eggs with a bunch of kids gathered around, all giggly, exchanging high-fives.
 
Brown stands out with his muscular build as the only male staff member at the elementary school. Kirk says Brown has been a "really positive male role model for all of our students."
 
Cody Brown’s role as SRO blends law enforcement with mentorship, offering a visible, supportive presence in the school community. By engaging in everyday activities with students, he reshapes perceptions of police, fosters trust, and positively impacts the children’s school experience.
 
"I look forward to coming to school every day and hanging out with the kids ... greeting the children as they get off the bus ... giving out a lot of high fives," said Brown. Then, he walks around the school, scooping things out and making sure everything is secure.
 
Every high-five, every story-time, and every deviled egg creates ripple effects that extend beyond the classrooms. “Our effect on the community starts in the school,” Brown said.
