## The Main Theme/Lede

One way of creating a transition is to make a subheading. It denotes to the reader a new chapter. This doesn't jar the reader.

> But the reader is not jarred because we have signaled the sudden shifts with the special subheads. The typographical device tells him that we aren’t trying to weave a seamless web here. This device and others like it—star dashes, or simply extra spacing between unrelated passages—is the prose equivalent of the film director’s sudden cut to a different scene
> 

> The last four paragraphs, set apart typographically, form a sort of epilogue. It is handled dispassionately, with no intrusion of the writer’s feelings, no bells and whistles—and that’s why it is effective. The bare recitation of facts in these paragraphs has an emotional wallop that derives from the reader’s knowledge of all that has gone before. Embroidering it would ruin it
> 

> great journalism. It does not skim over the surface of events but strikes deep and hard at the elemental core of human nature, and so is timeless in its appeal.
