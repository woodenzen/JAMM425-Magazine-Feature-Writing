One way of creating a transition is to make a subheading. It denotes to the reader a new chapter. This doesn't jar the reader. It is like a new story or a story within a store. A new lede and nut graph are helpful both for the reader and to set the tone for the writer. There are other typographical devices, such as a combination of a fleuron and line-shaped dinkus. [^1]
